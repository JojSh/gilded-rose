### Notes on this solution

The commit history should outline my approach to this challenge and you'll see from it that I tried to set the project up with Node in order to modularise its functionality and classes. However, the goblin's restrictions around leaving the global variable `items` in place made this plan unviable, so I reverted, removed my mocha tests and stuck with browser-based Jasmine tests instead.

Overall I've tried to favour simplicity and readability.
